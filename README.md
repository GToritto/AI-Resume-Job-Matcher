# 🤖 AI Resume Job Matcher

A smart, local, and fully free job-matching assistant powered by AI sentence embeddings.  
Upload your resume (PDF or DOCX), set a similarity threshold, and instantly find job listings that match your skills — all from a modern desktop GUI.

## 🧩 Features

✅ Upload resume in `.pdf` or `.docx`  
✅ Scrapes live job listings from [RemoteOK](https://remoteok.com)  
✅ Uses AI to match your resume to job descriptions  
✅ Adjustable similarity threshold (0%–100%)  
✅ Clickable job links  
✅ Export matches to CSV  
✅ Theme toggle: light / dark  
✅ Extracts top resume keywords (optional)

---

## 🔍 How It Works

1. Your resume is parsed into raw text.
2. It is converted into an **AI embedding** using `sentence-transformers`.
3. Job descriptions are also embedded.
4. Using **cosine similarity**, we find the most semantically similar jobs.
5. You see the matches in a sleek GUI — and can export or browse jobs instantly.

## 🧠 About the AI

This project uses the **MiniLM-L6-v2** model from [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2) via the `sentence-transformers` library.  
It creates vector embeddings of your resume and compares them to job descriptions using cosine similarity — enabling deep semantic matching beyond keywords.

## 📤 Export Example

Click **"Export to CSV"** to save your matches for follow-up.

```

Let me know if you'd like a `requirements.txt` file, or a GitHub Actions badge for CI/CD, too. I can even generate a `setup.py` if you want to distribute this as a package.
